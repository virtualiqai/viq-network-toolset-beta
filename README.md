> [!WARNING]
> **This is the beta release channel.** Builds in this repository are pre-release and may contain unfinished features, regressions, or instability. They are intended for testers and early adopters - not for production-adjacent use. For the stable production line, install from the [main release repository](https://github.com/virtualiqai/viq_eng_toolset) instead. Beta and stable installers can replace each other in place; your settings and data are preserved.

## Overview

VIQ Engineer Toolset is a desktop network operations workbench built by a working network architect, for working network engineers. Every tool addresses a real operational task: discovery, WLAN investigation, troubleshooting, security verification, performance measurement, or day-to-day reference. The application runs entirely on your workstation, requires no cloud account, and performs all device interactions in real time against the targets you point it at.

It is distributed as a single installer for Windows and macOS. Once installed, it launches in your default browser at a private loopback address and exposes its full tool catalog through a clean, dark-themed interface.

**What's new in 3.0 (beta):** a full **WLAN Investigator suite** (Wi-Fi diagnostics, roaming, DHCP, RADIUS, AP uplink, and RF reference), the native **Port Scanner** (which replaces the former Nmap-dependent scanner - no external `nmap` binary required), and **standardized, verdict-led PDF reporting across every tool**.

---

## Tool Catalog

The beta channel ships **39 tools** across six categories. The WLAN Investigator suite and the standardized reporting are new in the 3.0 beta line and are not yet part of the stable release.

### Discovery

| Tool | Description | Method |
|---|-------|----|
| **SNMP Port Mapper** | Walks a switch and correlates IF-MIB, BRIDGE-MIB, Q-BRIDGE-MIB, IP-MIB, LLDP-MIB, and CDP-MIB to produce a full port → MAC → IP → neighbor map; works across Cisco IOS / Catalyst / NX-OS (incl. pure-L2 Nexus access with no SVIs); optional L3 ARP correlation against a separate router (legacy `ipNetToMediaTable` + RFC 4293 fallback); structured diagnostic cards explain L2 / L3 failures with actionable checks; exports a real `.xlsx` port map | SNMP v1/v2c/v3 GET/GETBULK (read-only) |
| **Ping Sweep** | Sweep a CIDR for live hosts (capped at 254 hosts) | ICMP echo |
| **DNS Lookup** | A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, SOA, PTR records | DNS UDP/53 |
| **WHOIS** | Domain and IP WHOIS lookup | TCP/43 |
| **BGP ASN Lookup** | ASN owner and announced prefixes via RDAP | HTTPS RDAP (ARIN / RIPE / APNIC) |
| **MAC Address Lookup** | OUI vendor identification; exports a real `.xlsx` workbook | Offline OUI table |

### WLAN

| Tool | Description | Method |
|---|-------|----|
| **WLAN Investigator** | Guided, evidence-led Wi-Fi problem investigation - collects signal, roaming, DHCP, DNS, gateway, RADIUS, captive-portal, and cloud-application reachability, then renders a plain-language verdict with the supporting evidence trail | Native OS Wi-Fi APIs + active probes |
| **Wi-Fi Snapshot** | Point-in-time capture of the current association: SSID / BSSID, band, channel and width, RSSI, noise, PHY rate, and security | Native OS Wi-Fi query |
| **Roam Logger** | Continuously logs roaming events, BSSID transitions, and RSSI over time to characterize sticky-client and roaming behavior | Native OS Wi-Fi polling |
| **DHCP Probe** | Verifies DHCP reachability and inspects offer contents on the local segment | DHCP (UDP/67-68) |
| **AP Uplink Validator** | Validates the path from the associated access point upward - gateway reachability, RTT, and path/MTU characteristics | ICMP / TCP path probes |
| **RADIUS Probe** | Tests 802.1X / RADIUS authentication reachability and server response | RADIUS (UDP/1812) |
| **RF Toolkit** | RF reference and calculators - channel plans, band/width, dBm↔mW, and link-budget math | Offline |
| **WLAN Reference** | 802.11 standards, channel and DFS tables, and Wi-Fi terminology | Offline |

### Troubleshooting

| Tool | Description | Method |
|---|-------|----|
| **NetDiag Report** | Streaming combined DNS + ping + MTR + port scan + MSS probe + SSL diagnostics for a single host | SSE (Server-Sent Events); mix of ICMP, TCP, DNS, TLS |
| **Ping** | Single-host ICMP ping | System ping |
| **MTR / Traceroute** | Hop-by-hop latency and loss | System mtr or traceroute |
| **TCP Ping** | Handshake-based reachability and latency to a host:port, useful where ICMP is filtered | TCP connect |
| **Port Scanner** | Native per-host TCP/UDP port check with banner grab (capped at 100 ports). Replaces the former **Nmap Scanner** - no external `nmap` binary is required | Native TCP connect / UDP probe |
| **Switch Health** | Runs a strict allowlist of `show` commands over SSH and parses CPU, temperature, fans, PSU, uptime, and interface health; auto-detects IOS-XE vs NX-OS and runs the correct environment command. Hard-blocked from `configure`, `reload`, `clear`, `copy`, `write`, `erase` | SSH TCP/22 (read-only) |
| **Config Audit** | Static audit of a device configuration (Cisco / Arista / NX-OS style) for weak SNMP communities, telnet, default credentials, and missing logging; side-by-side startup-vs-running diff with change counts; optional read-only configuration download over SSH | SSH TCP/22 (read) + local analysis |
| **Connection Report** | End-to-end local connectivity report - adapter, gateway, DNS, internet path, and cloud-application reachability with a pass/fail verdict | Local checks + active probes |

### Security

| Tool | Description | Method |
|---|-------|----|
| **SSL / TLS Inspector** | Certificate chain, expiry, ciphers, SANs, and negotiated protocol versions | TLS handshake |
| **Ncat / Netcat** | Reference and command-builder UI | Informational only |
| **SSH Terminal** | In-browser xterm.js terminal to a target device (password, RSA, Ed25519, ECDSA, or DSS key, with a system-`ssh` fallback) | SSH TCP/22 |
| **SCP / SFTP Server** | Runs a local SFTP/SCP server so devices can push configurations to the workstation; native folder picker on both macOS (Finder) and Windows (Explorer) for the root directory | SSH TCP (configurable port) |

### Performance

| Tool | Description | Method |
|---|-------|----|
| **Internet Diagnostic (Speed Test)** | Streaming WAN speed test - multi-CDN download/upload throughput, idle vs loaded latency, DNS/path/MTU probes, a gauge cluster, per-workload verdicts (VoIP, video calls, gaming, VDI, streaming, VPN, and more), and a Wi-Fi-vs-internet root-cause verdict | SSE; HTTPS to public speed-test endpoints |
| **SockPerf** | TCP and UDP latency and throughput probe with built-in listener mode | TCP/UDP socket |
| **Bandwidth Calculator** | Throughput, transfer-time, and link-utilization math | Offline |
| **MSS Calculator** | Path MTU/MSS dual-probe (jumbo 9000 and standard 1500, DF-bit) - classifies jumbo, standard, tunnel-overhead, or fragmented paths | ICMP DF-bit probe |

### Utilities & Reference

| Tool | Description | Method |
|---|-------|----|
| **Subnet Calculator** | IP/CIDR math, broadcast, usable range, and wildcard mask; enumerates every `/N` block inside a user-selected parent network (Auto = 64 sibling blocks, or pin to `/24`, `/22`, etc.); input subnet highlighted in the table and PDF export | Offline |
| **IP Converter** | Base and format conversions for IPv4 and IPv6 | Offline |
| **IP Info** | Public-IP autodetect, geolocation, and PTR record | HTTPS to api.ipify.org and ipwho.is |
| **Wake-on-LAN** | Send a magic packet to wake a host | UDP broadcast or unicast |
| **Port Reference** | Searchable port-to-service mapping | Offline |
| **CIDR Table** | CIDR-to-netmask reference | Offline |
| **Activity Log** | Local audit log of every API call - method, path, status, duration; credentials redacted before insert; auto-purges after 14 days. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) | Local SQLite |
| **Wishlist** | Submit feature requests stored locally | Local |
| **About / Version** | Build information, update check, and release-channel selection | Local + version check |

> **Read-only by design.** With the exception of the SSH Terminal (operator-typed commands) and the optional SCP/SFTP Server (accepts inbound file pushes), the toolset issues no writes to target devices - no SNMP SET, no configuration commands, no `reload`, `write`, `erase`, or `clear`.

## Why This Toolset

- **Comparable scope to commercial engineer toolsets** - discovery, WLAN, troubleshooting, security, performance, and reference tools that traditionally require multiple separate utilities or a $1,500+ commercial license, consolidated into one application.
- **Runs entirely local** - no cloud account, no telemetry, no analytics. Outbound connections are limited to a single GitHub version-check at startup plus a small number of opt-in lookups (IP geolocation, ASN/RDAP) that only fire when the user clicks the corresponding tool.
- **Read-only safety by default** - the toolset will not modify a device configuration. Switch Health enforces this in code with a hard allowlist.
- **Real engineering** - built and refined against production enterprise infrastructure, not simulated labs.
- **One installer, no dependencies** - no Python install, no Docker, no Node, no npm. Download, install, launch.

---

## System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|------|-------|
| Windows | Windows 10 1809 or later / Windows 11 (x64) |
| macOS | macOS 12 (Monterey) or later (Apple Silicon - arm64) |
| RAM | 512 MB minimum, 1 GB recommended |
| Disk | ~100 MB installed |
| Browser | Latest Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari (auto-launched at startup) |
| Network - outbound | SNMP UDP/161, SSH TCP/22, DNS UDP/53, WHOIS TCP/43, DHCP UDP/67-68, RADIUS UDP/1812, ICMP, plus arbitrary TCP for the port scanner and SSL inspector |
| Network - inbound | Loopback only (`127.0.0.1`). The application binds to localhost; it never accepts external connections |

No Python installation, runtime, or other dependencies are required - everything is bundled.

## First-Run Security Warnings

This release is distributed as an independent, non-store binary. Because the publisher's binaries have not yet built a reputation with Microsoft SmartScreen, and macOS Gatekeeper requires Apple Developer ID notarization, both operating systems may display a security warning on first launch. **This is expected for any independent software publisher** and does not indicate that the software is malicious. The security posture is documented in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

### Windows - Microsoft SmartScreen

On first launch you may see: *"Windows protected your PC."*

1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

After a small number of installs across the user community, SmartScreen will begin recognizing the publisher automatically. A future release will be signed with a code-signing certificate to eliminate this warning entirely.

### macOS - Gatekeeper

On first launch you may see: *"VIQ Engineer Toolset cannot be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software"* or *"App is from an unidentified developer."*

**Option 1 - Right-click open:**
1. In Applications, right-click (or Control-click) the app
2. Choose **Open**
3. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

**Option 2 - System Settings:**
1. Try to open the app normally (it will be blocked)
2. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll to the bottom - you'll see the blocked app
4. Click **Open Anyway**

A future release will be fully notarized through the Apple Developer Program to eliminate this warning entirely.

---

## Shutting Down Properly

⚠️ **Closing your browser does not stop the application.** The backend continues running in the background.

To shut down cleanly:

- **In-app:** Click the **Shutdown** button in the application header
- **Windows:** Right-click the system-tray icon and choose **Quit**
- **macOS:** Use the in-app Shutdown button (no menu-bar icon)

If you close the browser without shutting down, simply reopen the application's URL (it is printed in the launcher window) and use the Shutdown button.

---

## Privacy & Telemetry

VIQ Engineer Toolset is designed to be transparent about every outbound connection. Network traffic from the toolset itself falls into three categories:

1. **Targeted device traffic** - SNMP, SSH, ICMP, DHCP, RADIUS, and TCP probes go directly to whatever device or host you point the tool at.
2. **Version check (always-on at startup)** - A single HTTPS GET to either `raw.githubusercontent.com/virtualiqai/viq_eng_toolset/main/version.json` (stable channel) or `raw.githubusercontent.com/virtualiqai/viq-releases-beta/main/version.json` (beta channel) depending on the channel selected on the About page, to check whether a newer release is available. No system information, IP address, or identifier is sent.
3. **Opt-in third-party lookups (only when you click the tool)** - `api.ipify.org` and `ipwho.is` for the **IP Info** tool, and RDAP queries to `rdap.arin.net`, `rdap.db.ripe.net`, and `rdap.apnic.net` for **BGP ASN Lookup**.

The application performs **no telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting, and no usage tracking.** Full details are in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

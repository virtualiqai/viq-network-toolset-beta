# Changelog — Beta Channel

All notable changes to **Virtual IQ AI NetOps Toolset — Beta channel** are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the pre-release identifier extension (e.g., `2.6.21-beta.1`).

Beta builds are produced from the `beta` branch of the private source repository by the same CI pipeline that produces stable builds. When a beta has been validated, it is promoted to the stable channel by dropping the `-beta.N` suffix and tagging on `main`; promoted versions appear under their clean number in the [stable channel changelog](https://github.com/virtualiqai/viq-releases/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

The stable-channel history below is mirrored here so testers have full context about what each beta is built on top of. Beta-specific entries (e.g., `[2.6.21-beta.1]`) are added above the stable history as betas ship.

---

*No beta builds shipped yet — the first `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` entry will appear here when the first beta is published.*

## [2.6.19] — 2026-05-22

### 🪵 `netops.log` Now Lands Where Users Can Find It

The previous build's diagnostic logging never produced a file on Windows because the rotating file handler was writing into `%PROGRAMFILES%\VIQ Engineer Toolset\assets\` — an admin-only path. Python's `RotatingFileHandler` silently swallows `PermissionError` on first open, so the log appeared to be working with no on-disk evidence to debug from.

v2.6.19 routes the log (and future runtime state) through a per-platform user-writable data directory:

- **Windows:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VIQ Engineer Toolset\netops.log`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/VIQ Engineer Toolset/netops.log`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/viq-engineer-toolset/netops.log` (default `~/.local/share/…`)
- Override available via the `NETOPS_DATA_DIR` environment variable.
- Falls back to the original install-bundle path if the user dir can't be created.

The resolved log path is now emitted on startup and surfaced through `/api/health` alongside the existing `data_dir` and `base_dir` so it's discoverable from the UI. The diagnostic wrappers around the SCP file path (`open` / `seek` / `read` / `write` / `close`) added in v2.6.18 finally have somewhere to write to.

### ✨ UI — Glow Survives `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`

Windows 11's Accessibility → Visual Effects → "Animation effects" setting (often Off on managed installs) makes Chrome/Edge advertise `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. The toolset's media query honors that by stripping every `animation:` rule — but the brand mark (header top-left) and the About page avatar derived their entire sapphire glow from the `kGlow` keyframe's `box-shadow`, with no base shadow on the static class. Animation off therefore meant glow off.

A static `box-shadow` fallback now lives inside the same media query so the brand identity stays visible even when animations are disabled by the OS.

## [2.6.18] — 2026-05-22

### 🩺 Diagnostic Build — Windows SCP Write Path

A targeted observability release for an open issue where Cisco IOS `copy running-config scp:` to a Windows VIQ Toolset host fails with `%Error writing scp://… (Unknown error -1)` even though the same client uploads successfully to a macOS VIQ host. asyncssh's SCP sink catches only `(OSError, SFTPError)` — any other exception propagates as a generic fatal error and Cisco renders it as `Unknown error -1`, with no server-side trace.

This build adds:

- `asyncssh` logger raised to **INFO** at startup so its SCP/SFTP events flow into the existing `netops.log` rotating file at the install root.
- Explicit `log.exception()` wrappers around the SFTP server's `open()` and the tracked-transfer file's `seek` / `read` / `write` / `close` so a full traceback (with `local_path`, `flags`, `pflags`, `parent_writable`, `bytes_so_far`) lands in `netops.log` regardless of which step throws.
- A new explicit `seek()` method on the tracked file wrapper — previously `seek` slipped through `__getattr__`, hiding any seek-stage failure from the existing error-marking path.

No behavior changes for users whose SCP/SFTP already works. After reproducing the Cisco error on Windows, send the most recent `netops.log` from `%PROGRAMFILES%\VIQ Engineer Toolset\netops.log` for diagnosis.

## [2.6.17] — 2026-05-21

### 🔧 SSH Stack Restored for Legacy Network Gear

Older Cisco, Arista, Juniper, Huawei, and MikroTik devices became unreachable in v2.6.16 because the upstream `paramiko` 4.x line removed the `DSSKey` class and tightened the default preferred-algorithm lists (ssh-rsa, ssh-dss, SHA-1 DH KEX). v2.6.17 pins `paramiko>=3.4,<4` so legacy host-key types, KEX algorithms, and ciphers are back in the default negotiation set without monkey-patching. SSH Terminal, Switch Health, and Config Audit now work against the same hardware they did in v2.6.1.

### 🧪 SSH Compatibility Test Suite

A new `tests/test_ssh_tools.py` pytest suite spins up an in-process paramiko mock SSH server (RSA + Ed25519 host keys) and exercises `_ssh_open_temp_shell`, `api_ssh_connect`, and the `/api/health` dependency diagnostic end-to-end. CI now runs this suite on both macOS and Windows runners *before* the PyInstaller build — if SSH is broken on either platform, the release is blocked.

### 🩺 `/api/health` Dependency Diagnostic

The health endpoint now reports a `dependencies` map indicating which Python libraries loaded successfully (`paramiko`, `asyncssh`, `cryptography`, `pysnmp`, …) and which feature blocks are affected when any are missing. SSH-related errors are also enriched with the offered algorithm lists from the failing handshake, making "Incompatible ssh peer" failures actionable instead of opaque.

---

## [2.6.16] — 2026-05-22

### Highlights

This release consolidates ~15 iterative beta builds (v2.6.2 through v2.6.16) into the new production line. The headline improvements are in **SCP/SFTP**, **Config Audit**, and **Switch Health**, plus a number of UX and reliability fixes the user community asked for.

### 🔐 SCP/SFTP Server

- **Port-22 forwarding via `pfctl` rdr** on macOS. The embedded SCP/SFTP listener still binds an unprivileged port (default 2222) so no part of the toolset runs as root continuously. Clicking "Install Port Forwarding" pops a single macOS admin-password prompt, after which a pf rdr rule redirects external port-22 traffic to the listener — letting network devices push to the standard SCP port without disabling macOS Remote Login, and without `sudo`-launching the whole app. Rule targets the live interface IP (via the pf `(iface)` macro) so packets stay routable; an earlier 127.0.0.1 redirect hit BSD's "martian packet" anti-spoofing drop. Removal is a single click that restores `/etc/pf.conf`.
- **Listener Host dropdown** — a Wireshark-style interface picker. The SCP/SFTP page enumerates every live IPv4 interface (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, USB tether, VPN tunnel, bridge) and lets you pick which one(s) to bind on. Port forwarding rules are installed only on the selected interface, so an active corporate VPN tunnel isn't accidentally exposed.
- **Native folder picker** for the Root Directory field (`📂 Browse…` button opens macOS's standard Finder folder-selection dialog). Plus a "Quick pick" dropdown for common paths (`~/Documents/VIQ-SFTP-Root`, `~/Downloads`, etc.). The text input still accepts any absolute path manually.
- **Default Root Directory** moved from inside the .app bundle to `~/Documents/VIQ-SFTP-Root` so files survive reinstalls and aren't hidden inside the application package.
- "Forwarding port 22 → 2222 on: en0 (10.93.139.213)" status line surfaces which interface is actually forwarded, so you don't have to drop to `sudo pfctl -s nat` to check.

### 🔎 Config Audit

- **Side-by-side aligned diff** replaces the bottom unified-diff dump. Startup config left, running config right, scroll-synced, with green/red/amber row colors and word-level highlighting on changed lines. New "Added / Removed / Changed" tile counts.
- **Whitespace-agnostic comparison** — config lines are normalized for the diff alignment (collapsed internal whitespace, stripped trailing whitespace) but the original device formatting is preserved in the display panes. False-positive diffs from pager artifacts and spacing inconsistencies are gone.
- **`--More--` pager handling** — when a Cisco device pauses output with `--More--`, the SSH read loop now sends a space character to advance. Earlier versions only stripped the literal text and let the device sit at the pager indefinitely, so `show running-config` returned ~60 lines (one PTY page) instead of the full config.
- **Boilerplate filtering** — lines like `Building configuration…`, timestamp comments, and bare `!` separators are excluded from the alignment so the diff focuses on real configuration drift.
- **Drift Status tile** shows the running count of differences (`14 diffs` instead of the previous "Difference Found" that didn't fit).

### 📡 Switch Health

- **SSE streaming with a 7-phase progress stepper** — connect, prep, version & inventory, CPU & resources, power · fan · temperature, interface errors, score health. Each phase reports completion text as it happens instead of one big spinner-and-wait.
- **Cancel button** appears on running operations; converts to "Dismiss" after failure so the post-failure stepper can be cleared.

### 🛡️ SSH connectivity

- **Legacy host-key + KEX algorithms** re-enabled for older Cisco / Arista / MikroTik / Huawei gear (`ssh-rsa`, `ssh-dss`, `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1`, group1-sha1, group-exchange-sha1, `aes128-cbc`, `3des-cbc`, `hmac-sha1`). Paramiko 3.x disables these by default, which produced "Incompatible ssh peer (no acceptable host key)" against the kind of equipment most engineers actually have to work with.
- Same legacy treatment applied to the system-`ssh` fallback path via `HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa,ssh-dss`, `KexAlgorithms=+...`, `Ciphers=+aes128-cbc,3des-cbc`.

### 🪟 Windows

- **PyInstaller spec now uses `collect_all()`** for `paramiko`, `cryptography`, `cffi`, `bcrypt`, `nacl`, `asyncssh`, `pysnmp`, `pyasn1` — pulls in the full native-extension and DLL trees that the static heuristic analysis was missing. Earlier Windows builds silently shipped without working SSH; v2.6.16 fixes Config Audit, Switch Health, and SSH Terminal on Windows.

### 🔔 Error log + diagnostics

- **Bell icon in the header** opens a session-scoped error log panel showing recent errors with timestamps, sources (`SCP/SFTP`, `Switch Health`, `Config Audit`, `About`, etc.), and detail strings. Red badge with the unread count. Clear button at the top of the panel.
- **`/api/health` exposes a dependency map** showing which optional native deps loaded successfully and what features each blocks if it fails. Future Windows-vs-macOS bugs diagnose in 5 seconds.

### ℹ️ About / Version

- **GitHub link** in the Developer card now actually points at the public release repo.
- **"Check for Updates"** now re-fetches the upstream `version.json` on each click instead of returning a startup-cached value. Uses proper numeric version comparison (so `2.6.10 > 2.6.9` is correctly recognized as an update — string compare previously got it wrong because `'9' > '1'` as characters).
- About page shows "Last Checked" timestamp and any check error inline.

### 🔧 CI / build pipeline

- **Workflow refactored to upload directly to `viq-releases`** — no intermediate GitHub Actions artifact storage. The free-tier 500 MB artifact quota was exhausted during the v2.6.x rapid-iteration cycle, blocking releases until the cache recalculated. The new pipeline has four jobs (`pre-release` → `build-macos` / `build-windows` in parallel → `finalize`) and is immune to the quota cliff.
- **SHA-256 checksums** are now generated in the `finalize` step from the actual uploaded artifacts (not intermediates), so they always match what users actually download.

### 🐛 Bug fixes / polish

- Stepper UI no longer auto-hides on failure; cancel/dismiss button persists so users can read the error before clearing.
- Per-tool error attribution in the bell log (errors show as "SCP/SFTP" or "Switch Health" instead of generic "Toolset").
- Activity-log middleware redacts credentials (community strings, passwords, SSH keys) before persistence — no-op on a public release but the protection has been there since v2.4.2 and applies to this release.

## [2.6.1] — 2026-05-21

### Brand Identity v1.0

This release introduces the official Virtual IQ AI brand identity across the application and repository.

- **New app icon.** The Windows installer, macOS DMG, taskbar/Dock icon, and system-tray glyph all use the new IQ ligature mark.
- **In-app header brand.** The dashboard header now displays the IQ mark inside a small dark card with the same pulsing sapphire glow used on the About avatar, alongside the "Virtual IQ AI" wordmark and "by Muhammad Kashif (KASH)" author attribution.
- **About / Version page.** Developer card now uses the brand mark in place of the previous lettermark; About copy updated to "Virtual IQ AI · USA".
- **Web favicons.** Full favicon set added — SVG, ICO multi-res, 16/32/192/512 PNGs, and Apple touch icon — so browser tabs and bookmarks reflect the new brand.
- **Theme color.** Added `theme-color` meta tag (`#0A0E1A`) so mobile and desktop chrome blend with the dark UI.
- **README banner.** GitHub repo home page now leads with the production brand banner instead of the placeholder Shields.io badge.

No functional changes to any tool. All read-only safety guarantees, rate limits, credential redaction, and SHA-256 checksum publishing carry over unchanged from v2.5.x.

---

## [2.5.1] — 2026-05-21

### UI Polish

- **Header attribution.** Split the dim single-line "Built by KASH" into three legible stacked lines so the author name is fully visible. Brand color and developer card refreshed with full bio and certifications (CCNP Enterprise / Data Center / Security, Microsoft AZ-700).
- Patch over v2.5.0 — no functional or security changes.

---

## [2.5.0] — 2026-05-21

### Verifiable Release Artifacts

This release introduces published download integrity verification.

- **SHA-256 checksums published with every release.** A `SHA256SUMS.txt` file is now attached to each GitHub release alongside the DMG and Setup.exe. Users can verify the integrity of downloaded artifacts before installation:
  - macOS / Linux: `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt`
  - Windows: `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 VIQ-Engineer-Toolset-Setup.exe`
- All other functionality unchanged from v2.4.2.

---

## [2.4.2] — 2026-05-21

### Initial Public Release

This is the first publicly available release of Virtual IQ AI NetOps Toolset. The application has been under continuous development against production enterprise infrastructure prior to this public availability. Version 2.4.2 reflects the application's internal release history; the product debuts publicly at this version.

### 🚀 Application Platform

- Cross-platform desktop application packaged as native installers for **Windows (NSIS)** and **macOS (DMG)**
- Bundled **Python 3.13** runtime — no separate Python installation required
- **Flask + flask-cors** backend bound to loopback only (`127.0.0.1`); never exposed externally
- Automatic port selection: tries `5001`, `7421`, `8765`, `9080`, `9090` in order, with ephemeral fallback
- Automatic browser launch on startup
- **Windows system-tray icon** with Quit menu (pystray)
- **Graceful shutdown** via in-app Shutdown button, system-tray menu, or SIGINT/SIGTERM
- **AES-256-GCM source-code protection** with native loader extension
- **Per-IP, per-tool rate limiting** with hard host and port caps to prevent accidental overrun:
  - SNMP: 6 rpm / 1 concurrent
  - Sweep: 3 rpm / 1 concurrent, max 254 hosts
  - Port scan: 5 rpm / 1 concurrent, max 100 ports
  - NetDiag: 4 rpm / 1 concurrent
  - fping: max 20 hosts
- **Loopback-only API** with optional PBKDF2-SHA256 (600k iterations) local-user authentication

### 🔐 Privacy & Credential Protection

- **No telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting, no usage tracking**
- Only outbound HTTPS request on startup is the GitHub version check
- Third-party lookups (IP Info, BGP ASN) are strictly opt-in per tool invocation
- **Device credentials are never persisted between runs** — no master credential vault exists
- **Activity log automatically redacts credential fields before insert.** A walker traverses each JSON request body and replaces values for approximately 20 credential-related field names (SNMP communities, SSH passwords, private keys, auth tokens) with `***REDACTED***`. Matching is case-insensitive and recursive into nested objects/arrays
- **`/api/ssh/*` and `/api/filetransfer/user/*` request bodies are excluded from activity logging entirely** as defense in depth
- Six unit tests cover the redaction logic across SNMP, password, private-key, nested-object, non-JSON, empty, and case-insensitivity scenarios

### 🔍 Discovery Tools
